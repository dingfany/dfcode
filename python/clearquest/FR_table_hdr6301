Problem: On the load platform, make traffic on all ONUs. Adjust optical power between -17 to -32 repeatedly at ONU PON side via the optical attenuator. The ONUs receiving power change from -17dBm to -32 dBm and then change back from -32dBm to -17dBm. When optical power is lower than -28dBm, the traffic stop. When optical power is larger than -28dBm, the traffic restore. After many times tests (several hours later),  few ONUs'traffic can not restore even if the optical power change back to normal. Then several minutes (about 5m) later, ONUs reboot and everything is OK. 
Workaround: yes
There is no way restore the whole system except reset ONU. In our system, there is a self-protection mechanism that if ONU keep long time(about 5min) in O1 with normal receiving optical power or in O2-3, the ONU will reboot automatically.

[20190320][minghuic]During the upgrade process, from the trace we can see ONU inactive, after inactive restart the upgrade version, in OMCI trace appear StartSoftwareDownload for two times. It may cause the upgrade time longer than expect. Need ONU team and Glob help to debug the issue.

[20190318][chengbli]Per current analysis, during ONU software upgrade(auto mode), ONU reboot before the software download complete, need involve CIG ONU(G-010G-Q and G-010G-P)  team to check it together why ONU reboot.
Per frequency view, only after one night script run, it will monitor the issue, minor impact.

Impact customer: ..."	"[20191112][sanghamt] As the Investigation is going on in CPE side ,so moving the FR to HDR team.
[20191121][mnavaux] FR still in the wrong team
[20191016][jadoull] Moving again to HDR team to analyze HS spread and why different from previous CPE releases
[20191016][mnavaux] After analyzing VCE traces, confirming that VCE is behaving as expected here. The impact on init time is due to the big spread in HS time. 
So the VCE is creating different joining pools based on the lines ready to proceed further. If we would not do that, the fast HS lines would wait for the slow HS lines and then timeout later in the init.
Therefore, the lines are joining in 3 cycles instead of 1 but the lines are reaching showtime.
[20191016][mnavaux] As already mentioned, this is not an FR, this is a new feature introduction (V43 on SRNT-D). And as such it should be handled by the feature team who committed the resources allocation at fC2.
Furthermore, and that was quite clear in BCM feedback, this is not a VCE or GFAST issue. This is a handshake issue. There is no reason to assign it to a VCE team.
Line 14 is taking more than 14sec to report HS. You cannot expect the VCE to wait that long.
Please assign it to the correct team.
[20190921][louisj] provide BB to CO team for verification and waiting for the result
[20190920]BCM gave a phy patch, BBA is verifying.

FPGA guolina  If downstream of one ONT in the PON cannot be synced, but other ONTs in this PON can be synced. I don't think it is related with OLT FPGA. So still wait DHBU make a conclusion. 
[20120228][huiyuanx] onu update bb supplied by DHBU chenhao(increase timer TO2), 128 ONT switches 39 times, ONT INACTIVE appears twice. need fpga guolina and chenhao analysis more.
[20120219][huiyuanx] involved tpm to ask fpag team to help analysis why synchronization failed.
[20120219][huiyuanx]DHBU update: down synchronization failed, TO2 timed out, no conclusion of root cause
[20200218][huiyuanx] update by chen hao: After switching, synchronization failed and TO2 timed out, resulting in failure to switch over.
[20200213][huiyuanx] chen hao had already supply bb for platform, today need time to restrore environment, pt will try to reproduce issue tomorrow.
[20200212][huiyuanx] involved onu team Chen, Chao 2. (NSB - CN/Shanghai) <chao.2.chen@nokia-sbell.com> to further investigation, they will supply bb version to platform for more useful trace.
[20200206][huiyuanx]  After switchover, glob open a ranging window to expect the serial number more times, but cannot receive it, then FPGA detect missing burst for ont, OLT send Deactivate PLOAM message to ONT, inactive alarm occur. After switchover, OLT receive the serial number for this ONT, ONT online again then inactive alarm cleared. The same issue as ALU02521943,  need to clear with ONT team.
[20200205][huiyuanx] Run night script to continuously trigger pg swithover,found some ont was inactive during switchover.After a while,the ont inactive alarm will get cleared automatically.
This issue rarely appear, but 438 276 these two onus occurs during these few times.
Suggest the submitter to check platform: onu link, and replace these onus when back to office.

Impact customer: ..."	"[2020/4/2][chunhuzo] Discussed with Xili and Hisense HW Engineer, GPIO25 is used to forward real HW RX_LOS signal from GPIO20 from PMD side. after checking, value and direction of GPIO20 is right, but value and direction of GPIO25 is not right.
Need to modify direction of GPIO25 to output if want to enable rx_los signal. Refer attached mail(discussion_20200402.msg).

[2020/2/6][chunhuzo] Need to check RX_LOS pin, suppose it's voltage level will be changed to abnormal high after reboot paragon. It will then cause LAN port down. 

[2020/02/13][chunhuzo] Based on current environment, the problem usually happened when ont reboot. Actually if paragon reboot, it also cause ont reboot. So I assume it is the same case.
Discuss with Intel Albrecht, need to force rx_los related gpio25 to low voltage in paragon test. Or paragon could not accept the test signal from SFP+. That's the paragon special limitation. So this FR could be unplanned in my understanding. Refer the attached related mail (gpio25 will keep high voltage level sometimes.msg) and FR ALU02652079.
FR ALU02652079 is not one same case, but ptp packet sent failure is also for the same reason(the voltage level of RX_LOS pin)."	""	"Latest Status:

Impact customer: Major"	"[20200319[bettonvv] Issue can't be reproduced when older version of ONT SW is used (3FE47493BGBA45). So issue was introduced in the setup when upgrading ONT SW to 3FE47493BGCB43. Further investigation to be carried out by ONT team.
[20200317][ftong] Tried 50 times all kinds of A2A swo, no issue observed after changing the ONT build to an older one. (3FE47493BGBA45)
[20200316][pduchi] Could reduce the problem by doing laser blink on the PON. I could see that for some ONTs 1/32 sometimes the eqD shifted far (>0x25). (see attachment). Submitter was asked to downgrade the ONT build. First tests with downgraded ONT were positive. Waiting for more tests.
[20200313][pduchi] BIPs, FEC uncorr, FEC corr seen on only the ONT that has the issue after switchover. Possibly related with not having 100% correct eqD after switchover.
[20200313][bettonvv] Investigation ongoing through remote debugging. No view yet on the root cause. ONTs are being re-ranged by GLOB as mitigation action due to continuous BIP errors after SWO leading to SDi alarm.

Title: [HDR6301][G140WH][BRZL]add invalid routing item, it was success....
Problem:[HDR6301][G140WH][BRZL]add invalid routing item, it was success. ...
Workaround: 

when i add ip routing as :
destination ip address is 135.251.207.92, destination netmask 255.255.255.0, bind ipv4 interface, then click add, WEB would pop up ' Destination IP Address and Destination Netmask are not match'. ----OK 

but when i add ip routing as:
Destination IP Address is 135.251.207.0, destination netmask 255.255.255.255, bind ipv4 interface, then click add, it could be ok to add. check routing table, it existed.-----NOK.

[2020/03/23][chunhuzo] IPS503275 submitted to track 3rd party issue.

[2020/03/23][chunhuzo] Do some test and still can not confirm the root cause. Test result refer attached mail(test_20200323.msg). Has sent mail to Intel Andy for confirmation. Issue can be reproduced in SDKv1.6.6.

[2020/03/20][chunhuzo] Xili and Changhua confirmed that the fix should be officially planed in OLT release ISR6203, and corresponds to HDR6301. Also involve quality team and release TPM, move FR from HD_R63 to HD_R6301 firstly. But will continue to debug to find the root cause.

[2020/03/18][chunhuzo] Use FWLT-B to test, don't reproduce this issue after 3 times. It possibly be one issue with FWLT-A based on the test result, will do test with new SW image by further and discuss with tester about this.

[2020/03/16][chunhuzo] OLT team propose to use FWLT-B for test and log collection as FWLT-A has been phased out.

[2020/03/12][chunhuzo] Analyzed and could reproduce once every two or three times. captured logs as attached (logs_20200312.zip).
Send mail to OLT team for log analysis firstly."	""	"Latest Status:
