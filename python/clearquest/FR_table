[20190627][gendarch] From BCM : most likely this is a CPE issue. However, I can imagine the same behavior would appear if for some unknown reason, the CO US traffic buffer is in a bad state, and the CO framer would flag an XOFF towards the CPE. In that case, we would never see any packets in the PTM counter. To check it, once in the bad state, can you trigger a corefile on the core that has a line that shows dead US traffic ?

Software Version:3FE47790AAAE02

Problem: 
[HDR6101][G-040W-Q][CHT]C50 2.4G data down stream total value is low with 32 simultaneous clients 

(M) What configuration: 
ONT information  2.4G 
Channel:6 
WLAN mode:VHT20 
security mode: WLA2-AES 


(M) Steps to create: 
1.Create 32 clients on port x, QoS type select""DiffServ"", value set to 0 
2.Assoiate all clients to the target SSID and start ARP resolved 
3.Create 1 client,QoS type select""DiffServ"",ToS value set to 0 
4.Create Bidirectional stream,packetlength set as 1518,protocol select UDP,Data load set to 64M. 
5.Run up stream 2 hours, down stream 2 hours, bidirection stream 2 hours 

Expected Results: 
1.Every unidirectional data stream is about 8M,packet loss is a%(a%<1%). 
2.For Bidirectional stream,up stream value should be close to down stream value, total stream value is close to max unidirectional value(load is 64)  . 
3.Clients should not be disconnect with target AP and stream should not be disturbed during 2 hours 

Test Results: 
For down stream, stream value is  much lower than max value(load is 64)  .

Impact customer: ..."	"[2019/10/31] [Robert Luo] Command ""pon debug_rogue_start"" does not work OK with XS010SA. Intel has offered a new process to simulate rogue ONU. Please see the file named 'simulate rogue ONU for XS010SA.docx' in attachment.
[2019/10/26][chunhuzo]Based on SDK1.5.2, the appearance changes. Currently, OLT could not detect rogue behavior and doesn't do any action after ""pon debug_rogue_start"" has been executed and OLT on-off command has been executed, has send mail to ISAM team and am discussing with them.
[2019/9/20][chunhuzo]Platform has provided API, app layer will verify and adapt next week.
[2019/9/4][chunhuzo]Discussed with Intel Platform Lanying, platform will provide one common Enable/Disable TX function based on basic i2cset operation and datasheet , then app layer could call them directly.
[2019/9/3][chunhuzo]Intel has provide solution via IPS update and Nokia need to check O7 alarm in use space app layer to do corresponding i2c operation. XS-010X-A is SFP schema and XS-010S-A is BOSA schema, so there is different way to close laser TX. Take XS-010X-A for example, ""i2cset -fy 0x51 0x6e 0x40"" could be used to close TX and ""pontop o-s"" could be used to check transceiver optic status. But for XS-010S-A, there is one different method to close TX and ""pontop o-s"" could not be used.
[2019/8/19][chunhuzo]Intel TangYin could reproduce this based on SDK1.3 andSDK1.4, IPS has been forwarded to R&D, wait for Intel plan.
[2019/8/15][chunhuzo]Submit one Intel IPS 00457001 to track this progress.
[2019/8/7][chunhuzo]OLT transport SW help to do analysis and need further discussion.
[2019/7/29][chunhuzo]Upload captured logs(GLOB log/OLT CLI/ONT console), waiting for OLT transport team investigation.
[2019/7/26][chunhuzo]Discuss with BBABU OLT expert, this is not one customer-related issue, so degrade its class to P3. SW is trying to capture GLOB for further verification.

[20190402][yaow]No OMCI log is available till now. Local is arranging an remote debugging session in the next day or two (still TBD). R&D will join remote debug session once it's ready.
[20190321][qianli]Waiting for the OMCI log continue, no any update from submitter
[20190308][qianli]Waiting for the OMCI log, no any update from submitter
[20190301][qianli] the problem occurs after ""2019-02-21 10:38:54[al]factory reset by CLI."", following this log in customer file, this first right time that we can get from this file is ""2019-02-21 10:41:15""

And then I checked the syslog which running with this time. In file 2 - AMS ONT CFGCLI and Reboot.txt , it start from line 2102, and end at line 2552, from start to the end, it takes 4:33, as the submitter said, the ONU online takes 5 minutes, so the problem occurs at this time.

From these log, I found 2 points seems abnormal, but may be at that time just no log output.

Point 1:
2019-02-21 10:41:15[cr]evtmgr:275processVlanTransStatus:41:======processVlanTransStatus:action=0======
2019-02-21 10:41:23[cr][  123.014000] protocol 0806 is buggy, dev pon_u_0_1
There is 8 seconds no any output, maybe something block.

Point 2:
Line 2551: 2019-02-21 10:41:32[no]cfgmgr:292rts_ManagementServerObject:112:config itms ConnectionRequestPassword : qqybitqrzaexwk
Line 2552: 2019-02-21 10:44:06[no]Password auth succeeded for 'ONTUSER' from 192.168.2.1:40902
There is 2:41 no any output, so it seems there is something block.

From the log in FRs, I just can get this info, I need omci log to see at these no output time is ONU block or just not output to syslog.

[20190228][qianli]Wait for local team provide omci log.
[20190227][yaow]OMCI team continues working on this case.

1. set the version 3FE46606FGCB48 as 3FE46606FGCB49 in the cloud server, and configure it as the version under download
2.start cloud server
3.the current ONT version is 3FE46606FGCB48
3.ONT check the version and download success
4.after ONT reboot, it's version is still 3FE46606FGCB48 and it will check the version 3FE46606FGCB49 as new and download it then reboot ONT.

this will always go on until server change the FW version file.

[20190822] [fzhu005] Reproduced the issue. According to the OMCI messages, OLT just ask ONT to do DSCP to pbit mapping for Ethertype = 0x0800. But IPV6 Ethertype is 0x86DD. That means OLT not ask ONT to do DSCP to pbit mapping for IPV6."	""	"Latest Status:

So the root cause is likely on the OLT 237. OLT team has been involved. Currently it is likely because the version of OLT is different.
[2019/10/9][Robert Luo]I have tried with another OLT and cannot reproduce the issue. PT will have a double check.
[2019/10/8][Robert Luo]Wu Yong from OLT team has helped check the  log of OLT and find there are many alarms such as DOW,SDI,SFI,LCDGI that cause the DEACTIVE. We will have a try with another OLT with the help of PT.
[2019/9/26][Robert Luo]After catching the log of ploam, omci and OLT, I have determined the root cause is OLT sends the DeactiveOnuId PLOAM msg to ONT. That causes the ONT state from O5 to O2. Then there are many msgs will transfer between OLT and ONT. If the ONT does flashing at the same time, the issue occours. We will involve OLT team to invetigate why OLT sends the DeactiveOnuId PLOAM msg to ONT.
[2019/9/25][Robert Luo]The issue can be reproduced on HDR58/60/61/62. The root cause is likely the OLT deactives the ONT periodly. The severity has been downgrade to 3. See the attachments.
[2019/9/24][Robert Luo]Have try with the three versions in the FR, it can only be reproduced between 13:00-14:00. Why it happens is unknown.
[2019/9/23][Robert Luo]Have a test of early version 62.001 of HDR62. Current it works OK after two round. The test is that compile three version with different names with same changeset and then change version with them. And try with 62.062 involuded in the FR, the issue doesnot reproduced in one round.
[2019/9/19][Robert Luo]In the log, OLT sends the deactive-ONU-Id msg to ONT. We need check the cause.

Problem: Mesh network is built well by wifi.One G-140W-H and two B1 build a mesh network.Putting G-140W-H in the middle and the other two B1 are in the next side.The topology is beacon1--->G-140W-H<---beacon2. 
If no multicast video is in the mesh network, the 5G TXOP is good (more than 70). If one 4K multicast video is played on the B1, the 5G TXOP will be about 50. And the same time, the second 4K multicast video is played on the other B1. The 5G TXOP will be about 10 and decrease a lot, which will impact the 5G Wi-Fi's connection and service.

[20190705][changjh] Hard to reproduce, under reproducing
[20190724][hugow] No useful information from the core file. Added log and built private image to reproduce. Not reproduced till now.
[20190726][hugow] Cannot be reproduced with private image. Have built another version and trying it again.
[20190731][hugow] The problem is reproduced. From the log and crash file, the crash was caused by Memory corruption. - The function map pointer of one class object is NULL.
It could be caused by memory overwirting or the class object is delocated somewhere. Continue investigating.
[20190802][hugow] It's hard to locate the root cause from code level or log. Looking into related FRs to see if there's any clew.
[20190805][hugow] Build a private image to track the corrupted pointer in common trace function. Then each line of the log will show value of the tracked memory. Open SIPM and PAL log and reproduce the problem - try to narrow down the problem.
[20190809][hugow] Have run the script for one week but the issue is not reproduced. Now only open SIPM/SSAPI log and continue trying.
[20190814][hugow] Still not reproduced. Not sure if opening the log makes the issue even harder to be reproduced. So only open SIPM log and try again.
[20190816][hugow] Built another private build and change PAL's thread priority to 0xfe. Keep trying to reproduce.
[20190823][hugow] Still not reproduced. Built another private build and only open log just before the issue occuers, also force crash once the memory is overwritten. Keep trying to reproduce.
[20190830][hugow] Not reproduced. Also tried the latest official image but the problem not occurred.

[20190909][yaow]Keep discussing with TEC.
[jzhan088] [20190905] Same to Linux PC, If iphone do not extend the lease when ONT rebooted, The DHCP server was running without knowning of this iPhone. When iPhone trying to renew the lease, DHCP server would reject this Request and allocate a new IP address.
This is also expect behavior.
[20190910] [jzhan088] The root cause is one of devices did not response the ARP query. It might be stuck in DHCP Request stage but since DHCP leases were removed, the DHCP request was ignored and was not acknowledged.
When ARP query is not answered, so the DHCP server allocated 192.168.1.64 to iPhone (20:ee:28:52:58:93) and subsequently was declined by it (iPhone might discovered the IP conflict by GARP).
So we have to allocate a new IP, and then you saw the IP changed to a new one (192.168.1.64).

[20190929][wadixon][wendycw] Suspect ONT issue. Sent mail to Zhao Kai. Waiting for ONT colleague's confirmation.
Followings are perliminary analysis:
1. Checked the OMCI message sent from OLT to ONT when run 'command start', and found the OMCI messages are exactly same between success case and failed case.
2. Checked the OLT IWF package statistic and trace print of the failed scenario.
Package statistic for PPPoE was like this:
rxPPPoEDiscPkts     = 4  
txPPPoEDiscPkts     = 2
Need check whether PADO is received on ONU and why no PASR is send out from ONU.
[20191202][yliu099] Found another issue when verify the FR, after stop/restart the simulation, the simulation can't be successful either, only reboot ONU can recover it."	""	"Latest Status:

After initial analysis, ONT enter O7 after receiving Disable Serial Number message from OLT in O3 state.
Check point:

But still need to do more analysis to the logs such as message(syslog) and try to find the reproduction scenario. This will help to reduce the issue scope. Meanwhile, need to discuss with other colleagues and BCM to query how to check TX state when issue happened.

[2019/10/11][chunhuzo]Discussed with tester, the issue ever appeared 4 times and he will help to reproduce it again, once reproduced, SW will check environment. 
From SW view, this issue is because luminous is not normal during some cases but if can not find the rule, this issue is hard to fix and temporarily can not submit CSP to BCM."	""	"Latest Status:

1. ONT will reboot once it is implemented with factory reset. After ONT is up, all POTS line will power on. This is common. For resetting voice profile,  it is different from factory reset, it is expected that POTS line will not have power after set X_ALU-COM_DelAddVoice.
2. After trying 100 times X_ALU-COM_DelAddVoice, ONT POTS line always keeps power off. Will discuss with user on the test result.

[2019-10-18, Shawn Li]:
The root cause why sometimes POTS line does not lose power is below:
Some phones will report offhook and onhook event after being registered. The duration is 1 second or so. If user select to do reset voice profile exactly before the onhook event reported, inprogress power down will not take effect, the coming onhook will give park signal to POTS line. Suggest user to use a phone set that does not report offhook/onhook event after registeration."	""	"Latest Status:

[201907012][yimingg] T&W Qichao executed interposer experiment on 7B1 to double check reboot situation on 11th Jul and no reboot in 3 hours. When Nathan added interposer to 5A8 DDR, in 25hours no reboot happened,when remove interposer, every 3~5 minutes reboot occurred of 5A8. Nathan updated that the reboot will be related to SI. Cidong sent 10pcs interposer to Qichao on 4th Jul. 
[201907011][yimingg] T&W Qichao executed on 7C2 @root temperature, with Vref_CA 650mV then 2 times reboot happened, but Vref_CA 800mV then no reboot happened during 3.5 hours on 11th Jul. Nathan executed external DC PSU experiments and send out report on 8th Jul. Nathan confirmed  VTT can be modified to high or low by R203/R204; VTT can only be modified to high with external DC PSU, when VTT was lower than 700mV or 650mV, then no reboot; when higher than 750mV, always reboot. Nathan checked Vref_CA under 700mV or above 850mV all pass, Vref_DQ can't be modified to pass. Then Winbond R&D considered the issue should relate to SI, and should be voltage step at around 750mV. Further simulation needed, and further resolution operations needed.
[201907010][yimingg] Winbond Nathan suggested to change DRAM E-fuse to Increase DRAM tIH margin and verify the issue. E-fuse is a DRAM test mode with ATE and special SW driver, and DRAM need to be in operation mode. E-fuse should be quite high current to burn-down fuse inside DRAM, normally used for engineering debug. If mass production need to involve in e-fuse then special part number for DDR may be needed. E-fuse can be executed only once, mainly for TIS/TIH/TDS/TDH, and can't be recovered.
[20190709][yimingg] Winbond Nathan executed 45C/25C/-5C tests with 393 but the difference between 45C and 25C is not explicit on 11th Jul. Nathan executed 45C/25C/-5C, with 5A8 failure DUT, with 5.02L05 Nokia firmware and record 1 hour reboot frequency,and 10min shmoo training/ 3 times, and fa"	""	"Latest Status:

[20190816][yaow]BB is under testing in field.
[20190809][tobyw] The reason of downloadling failure is found and verified. The platform team has found the reason of flashing image error which once happened and now is testing. 
[20190805][luckh] The BB worked well on a new ONT. Local team will verify this on more ONTs.
[20190801][tobyw] The BB still failed to upgrade. However, from the log I found the download was already successful but flashing image error happened. Now I needed help from platform. 
[20190729][tobyw] I make a BB to solve this problem. Since I have no huawei OLT, I change some code to simulate this problem. From the result I think it can work. Then I give the BB to site for test. However, the ONT reboots. From the log I think it is caused by unstable PON signal. The site colleague says he will check the environment and do the test again.
[20190725][tobyw] I make a tool to check 3FE47959BGBB26 and find some duplicate segments in this image. By checking OMCI code, I think this may cause some problems. I will confirm further and may make a BB to test.

When Nathan added interposer to 5A8 DDR, in 25hours no reboot happened,when remove interposer, every 3~5 minutes reboot occurred of 5A8. Nathan updated that the reboot will be related to SI. Cidong sent 10pcs interposer to Qichao on 4th Jul. 
[201907011][yimingg] T&W Qichao executed on 7C2 @root temperature, with Vref_CA 650mV then 2 times reboot happened, but Vref_CA 800mV then no reboot happened during 3.5 hours on 11th Jul. Nathan executed external DC PSU experiments and send out report on 8th Jul. Nathan confirmed  VTT can be modified to high or low by R203/R204; VTT can only be modified to high with external DC PSU, when VTT was lower than 700mV or 650mV, then no reboot; when higher than 750mV, always reboot. Nathan checked Vref_CA under 700mV or above 850mV all pass, Vref_DQ can't be modified to pass. Then Winbond R&D considered the issue should relate to SI, and should be voltage step at around 750mV. Further simulation needed, and further resolution operations needed.
[201907010][yimingg] Winbond Nathan suggested to change DRAM E-fuse to Increase DRAM tIH margin and verify the issue. E-fuse is a DRAM test mode with ATE and special SW driver, and DRAM need to be in operation mode. E-fuse should be quite high current to burn-down fuse inside DRAM, normally used for engineering debug. If mass production need to involve in e-fuse then special part number for DDR may be needed. E-fuse can be executed only once, mainly for TIS/TIH/TDS/TDH, and can't be recovered.
[20190709][yimingg] Winbond Nathan executed 45C/25C/-5C tests with 393 but the difference between 45C and 25C is not explicit on 11th Jul. Nathan executed 45C/25C/-5C, with 5A8 failure DUT, with 5.02L05 Nokia firmware and record 1 hour reboot frequency,and 10min shmoo training/ 3 times, and fa"	""	"Latest Status:

Impact customer: HIGH"	"[20191203][yimingg] Put 6 ONTs in the chamber , only add one telephone in off-hook state, set the temperature up to 50C . After test 72hours, one ONT can't power on, the single-wired transistor was damaged , and there were over-heating marks on transistor , the same as what customer reported.
[20191129][yimingg] According to the transistor provider's analysis report, the critical electrical characters (HFE : Current magnification of transistor ) of the component will decrease (as shown in the table below, HFE = 89.51/63.8,HFE Requirement  is more than 100 ). This causes that the transistor is not compliant to ONT HW  design, which makes the transistor have lower efficiency and leads to the heat congregation. It may cause the final damage of the transistor. 
As required by Nokia, the transistor provider has provided single-wired transistor samples. During testing we found that the transistor case temperature of the single-wired sample is higher(about 10 degrees ) than normal ones.
[20191122][yimingg] KEXIN send the single-wired compoment to Nokia HW R&D, R&D start to test voice service try to reproduce this issue.

[20191108][yimingg] KEXIN feedback their analysis report. 
The investigation report shows that one of the copper wires inside transistor has dropped from the silicon after cleaning.  Even it appears the copper wire was attached to the silicon initially before cleaning, it is highly suspected that the connection point was not robust enough thus leading to overheating conditions on the transistor.
From the over-heating mark remaining on the silicon (ref picture 'After clean'and 'after move wire'), it can be observed that the heat was not balanced on the upper wire and lower wire. Through the lower wire, however it got dropped after cleaning, it is supposed the current is smaller, producing less heat than the upper wire. That's why we suspect t"	""	"Latest Status:

Problem: 
2 stacked VLAN port is added on the same bridge port 1/1/2/3/1/14/1, up/down INTERNET WAN (vlan 210) to make ONT send DHCP packets.  DHCP upstream packets with vlan 105 are received on ONT PON mirror, this is correct. But DHCP upstream packets with vlan 1005:105 and 1002:105 are received on OLT LT mirror,  this is incorrect.
configure bridge port 1/1/2/3/1/14/1 vlan-id 210 tag single-tagged l2fwder-vlan stacked:1005:105 vlan-scope local
configure bridge port 1/1/2/3/1/14/1 vlan-id 220 tag single-tagged l2fwder-vlan stacked:1002:102 vlan-scope local
Test Steps:
1. Provision ONT with stacked vlan service.
2. Disable and enable ONT WAN.
3. Check DHCP pakcets on ONT and OLT sides.
Expected Result:
1. In step3, DHCP upstream packets with vlan 105 are received on ONT PON mirror, DHCP upstream packets with vlan 1005:105 are received on OLT uplink port.
Actual Result:
1. In step3, DHCP upstream packets with vlan 105 are received on ONT PON mirror. But DHCP upstream packets with vlan 1005:105 and 1002:105 are received on OLT LT mirror.

[20190830][boch] Confirmed by ONT team, it's the ONT capability issue, ONT supports up to 8 T-CONT for Traffic and 1 for OMCI, which doesn't match the capablity reported from ONT (9), While this create the issue when OLT allocates the 9th T-CONT. ONU team is working for solution.
[20190830][boch] Reproduced again, joint debug ongoing with ONT team.
[20190829][boch] Check with ONT team (via Zhao Kai) whether something can be checked from ONT side.
[20180828][jingfenz]issue reproduced. onu have 9 tcont. BER will be increased significantly when configuring the last available tcont(instance id 8008, allocID 265).BER increasing will raise a SFi alarm which will cause glob sending deactivate_ONU-ID message to onu.
[20190823][fehong]With current implementation, if TCONT provisioning via OMCI is out of ONT capability, ONT will return failure thus alarm will be raised and no DBA will be allocated. Thus there is no reason to see impaction on other ONTs. Requiring traces for the whole provisioning to see what happens, PT reproduction is delayed.
[20190819][fehong]GponMgnt team is in high load, investigation is delayed.
[20190812][fehong]Other ONTs might get impacted when TCONT provisionning is out of capability of ONT.

[20190729][tobyw] I make a BB to solve this problem. Since I have no huawei OLT, I change some code to simulate this problem. From the result I think it can work. Then I give the BB to site for test. However, the ONT reboots. From the log I think it is caused by unstable PON signal. The site colleague says he will check the environment and do the test again.
[20190725][tobyw] I make a tool to check 3FE47959BGBB26 and find some duplicate segments in this image. By checking OMCI code, I think this may cause some problems. I will confirm further and may make a BB to test.

[20191219][chunhuzo]Use WTD optic which is for BCM in XS-010X-A, no such issue. It should be one issue related with transceiver. Have involved PA and sent mail to EOPTOLINK Jerrica for confirmation. Wait for the feedback.
Also discussed with lanying, consider whether could do one workaround for this, but there are two difficulties from arch angle:
1.It is impossible to judge PLOAM state in RSSI Module
2.Possible but have to add dependencies to GPIOMGR in RSSI Module, this is one workarond solution and will corrupt the whole architecture.
Based on this, the workaround is not suggested from SW view. 

[20191219][dayongw]Relative with HW, Tx Power have but bias current is Zero. XS-010X-A have, but don't exist on XG-010X-A; Lanying check with hardwaer Hukai.  Use the opitic set to BCM or XS-020X-A optic to XS-010X-A.

[2019/12/18][chunhuzo]Investigate with PT Tang Hao, Platform Wei Lanying, this issue appears only in XS-010X-A. Based on understanding it should be common for XS-010X-A and XG-010X-A. Need do investigation by further.
This is reproduced in local environment again.
Firstly, execute ""ont-enable disable"" to force ont to O7;
Then execute ""omcli omciMgr showRSSI"" to see the result is not ok;
Execute ""gpio_tool read 300"" to see the value is 0 indeed;
After a while, execute ""omcli omciMgr showRSSI"", the result is ok....
Pls refer attachment: local_reproduce_xs010xa_20191218.txt

[20191217][dayongw]need re-confirm with ORFR image, re-check with tanghao's version
[2019/12/4][chunhuzo] Do some investigation, and in U-050X-A, there is also such issue. Use one type of MTK board and XS-010S-A to do test, the result is ok.

[jzhan088] [20190905] Same to Linux PC, If iphone do not extend the lease when ONT rebooted, The DHCP server was running without knowning of this iPhone. When iPhone trying to renew the lease, DHCP server would reject this Request and allocate a new IP address.
This is also expect behavior.
[20190910] [jzhan088] The root cause is one of devices did not response the ARP query. It might be stuck in DHCP Request stage but since DHCP leases were removed, the DHCP request was ignored and was not acknowledged.
When ARP query is not answered, so the DHCP server allocated 192.168.1.64 to iPhone (20:ee:28:52:58:93) and subsequently was declined by it (iPhone might discovered the IP conflict by GARP).
So we have to allocate a new IP, and then you saw the IP changed to a new one (192.168.1.64).

Ookla result is upsteam: 6Mbps, downsteam:527.86Mbps. If change bandwidth to 'committed-info-rate 0 assured-info-rate 0 excessive-info-rate 1000000', Ookla result is upsteam:938Mbps, downsteam:940Mbps.
Test Steps:
1. Set ONT qos interface to 'committed-info-rate 0 assured-info-rate 50 excessive-info-rate 6000 delay-tolerance 32'.
2. Test ONT performace with Ookla.
3. Set ONT qos interface to 'committed-info-rate 0 assured-info-rate 0 excessive-info-rate 1000000'.
4. Test ONT performace with Ookla again.
Expected Result:

Problem: 
Download attached CFG fiile to ONT to enable GRE SSID 2 and SSID6, but after downloading is finished, I can't find SSID 2 and SSID 6 with laptop and mobile phone.
Test Steps:
1. Provision ONT pre-configuration and make sure HSI service is up.
2. Download attached CFG file to ONT with CLI command 'pland-cfgfile1 CFGCHRA019 dnload-cfgfile1 CFGCHRA019'.
3. Check SSID 2 and SSID 6 status.
4. Connect laptop and mobile phone to SSID 2 and SSID6
Expected Result:
1. In step 3, SSID 2 and SSID 6 is up.
2. In step 4, laptop and mobile phone can connect to SSID 2 and SSID 6.
Actual Result:
1. In step 3, SSID 2 and SSID 6 is down.
