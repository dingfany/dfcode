Impact customer: Na"	"[20200109][fzhu005] New SDK 502L07 has dropped the packages sending to OMCI channel in bcmenet module. We will adopt similar solution in SDK 416L04. 
[20200106][fzhu005] Open one CSP CS9597221 to trace the issue. 
[20191211][dayongw] MIB upload have ipv6 packet, only have the packet during setup, OMCI interface configure IPV6 address. zhenyu's solution solve part of invalid packet, except IPV6 ICMP packets sent from kernel. drop in OMCI GEM, will drop in HDR63.
[20191210][fzhu005] Root cause is clear and the solution still need evaluated, may be involved risk. Or we can ignore the issue because it will not influence the data service.  
[20191206][fzhu005] Another candidate solution is that dropping those packages in BCM driver. BB can work OK but need evaluate the solution. 
[20191128][fzhu005] Candidate solution is delete the IPV6 address in the virtual interface.
[20191122][fzhu005] When ONT configure IPV6 address, it will send those ICMPV6 messages to Wan and Lan side. To wan side, it will use the OMCI gemport to send.
[20191028][fzhu005] The issue still can be observed recently. Will test and observe continually if setup available.  
[20191018][fzhu005] Will discuss the issue with L2 forwarding/OMCI expert continually. 
[20190920][changjh]Will continue investigating in next release, not easy to figure out. Moved from BBA. ONT sends IPV6 packet to OMCC. No clear direction now.
[20190912] [fzhu005] According to FR submitter's feedback, the issue seems that not be observed resently. No idea at present. 
[20190907][luckh] OLT receives a invalid packet from OMCI gem during the progress of MIB_UPLOAD. Seems like this is a IPV6 packet. No idea by now. Is involving more people.
[2019-07-30][heqiang]Wan xin has collect the packet by tracespan, it's approve that the wrong packet in omci channel is come from ont side. pls refer to the mail in attachment. Pls ont team help further check.
[2019-07-30][zhigangj]still waiting for liu yan's setup for further check.

[20190906][luckh] in kernel, bcmdrv maintains a queue for received OMCI messages. It's a producer/consumer model. Producer(a task to handle CPU OMCI queue interrupt) will put new message in the queue, and consumer(a ioctl task) will read message from the queue. When the issue is observed, the producer can't put any new message in the queue, because the queue is full, so all the new messages will be dropped. The queue becomes full, seems like the consumer is not re-scheduled. At the beginning, when consumer comes to read message, it will first check if there's any message in the queue, if the queue is null, it will hold itself and release CPU to other tasks. When the producer puts new message in the queue, it will wakeup the consumer. But in this issue, seems after the producer try to wake up the consumer, the consumer is not re-scheduled. Will study more and involve kernel experts to comment.

Have discussed this issue with PA, need to change the usage strategy of pbit_to_gem table(like dynamic allocation), but need more effort to do this, so we will discuss it with PA to add a PI or RCR to do this function in next release and unplan this FR in this release.

Plan to use reference board to do the verification, but even though still need to verify it via XS-010S-A after SDK integration.

[2019/11/14][chunhuzo]IPS00472585 has new update. Intel has reproduced this issue in their environment. Current progress is that:
If the LAN port link gets broken for a while and then re-connected again. The TX timestamping breaks heavily and cannot recover itself. Investigation is ongoing.

Try to do modification and compile image for verification.
BB image 3FE47764EEES52 is provided to fix the issue. could download zip file attached: fix-20191214-image_diff_and_logs.zip
3FE47764EEES52.sigr is signature version, could rename it to 3FE47764EEES52 to use it.

[2019/12/3][chunhuzo]
Discussed with Intel Dima for this issue and based on his proposal, modify and build BB for verification.
Patch pls refer attached patch_for_ALU02630669.diff
BB pls refer attached BB_for_ALU02630669_20191202.rar
After verification, the tod alarm occur and clear time is short, but seems it will still take a bit long for 1588 sync. That's to say two way time error need a bit long time to become normal.

[2019/11/29][chunhuzo]
BB doesn't work, clock can not synced any more even after a very long time.
synce and 1pps event enable failed seems FW doesn't initialize successfully.

[20191219][xswang] Can't reproduced in a short time, we low down the  serverity from 2 to 3, agree with PT.
[20191218][danielwa] As there is no such issue in Shanghai PT's similar setup, it is suspected it is is environment issue in QD PT's setup, QD PT will do the same test with other kind of ONUs.
[20191217][danielwa] This issue is reproduced in QD PT's setup today, the receiver power is -19dbm at OLT side, which should be OK, but the ONU PLOAM failed to transfer from O3 to O4, Wang Xin is checking it
[20191213][danielwa] This issue cannot be reproduced on PT's setup, Wang Xin will check with Li Shennan about it this week
[20191211][xswang] use PT environment cannot repeat, need wait Lishengnan back from vacation.
[20191210][luckh] confirmed with Wang Xin who will further support the rx/tx abnormal issue with 40KM.
[20191203][luckh]  checked from Carrie's setup, tx is abnormal, onu can't send out any message. Need platform team + hw team to further check.
[20191120][crshan] 
After check the log, the key values of optics level (opticRx and opticTx) are all -inf. There may be something wrong with the optics module. The tester has ruled out the problem of the equipment and optical fiber quality and is checking the bit error rate of OLT side and whether this CI G240GE support 40KM optical fiber.

[20191214][jeffreyl]After checking with OLT expert, this issue is caused by DS GSQ packt going into the incorrect priority queue which has lowest priority, so that it was dropped when traffic has higher priority in UNI is full.

3. plug off fiber, send long tx power, long tx power is ok, it means that optical module is ok.

[2020/1/19][chunhuzo/kerry] Mail discussion, code review and diff has been sent out, wait for the final conclusion. Mail attached(discussion_and_code_FR ALU02648035.msg).

[2020/1/17][chunhuzo] Solution confirmed, will remove PEE sent as it can not be received correctly after enable long luminous, also move setOperationStateToO7() to ISR from gpon task.

[2020/1/14][chunhuzo] Discussed via CS9578606, could use following command to force ploam state to O7
bs /b/c gpon link_activate=deactivate
bs /b/c gpon link_activate=activate_O7
But it will cause link state kept in O7, even receive Disable SN message with active option, only ploam state enter O5 and link state could not enter O1 and will always keep O7.
Discussed with Peihua, still use previous setOperationStateToO7() to switch ploam state to O7.
But need to move setOperationStateToO7() to ISR.
So the final thing is how to confirm PEE, because need to send PEE before close TX power.
Coding and under verification.

[2020/1/3][chunhuzo] Move to HD_R6201a based on previous discussion, Peihua suggest to use rdpa_gpon_link_activate_set(O7)  to replace setOperationStateToO7(). Checked function declaration, it could be used on task context.
But tested that ""bs /b/c gpon link_activate=activate_O7"" will fail, error info is as follows:
ERR: bdmf_configure#1544: gpon: status:Internal error. config:link_activate=activate_O7

1. all device onboarding success.
2. login G3 to change channel to ensure mesh networking would be success again. for example change channel from 64 to 60, bandwidth from 40M to 80M, then save.
3. it would pop up ''error set LanWlanObjiect:5' in 5 seconds. see message in the attachment.

[2020/2/14][chunhuzo] Discuss with Allen, Yongli and Regan, could do more test and investigation, perhaps need to figure out why ploam state change in long duration test. Even without short-term holdover adaption, could keep same behavior with U-050X-A. For short-term holdover, it is one enhancement and could do it by further.

[2020/2/13][chunhuzo] Discuss with Albrecht, ploam state change will cause SyncE state change. But as chipset support short-term holdover (15s), so no need to degrade clockClass to 248 directly when SyncE state become not synced, could use one more appropriate clockClass 135 between 15s, if SyncE state not restored to synced in this period, then will degrade to clockClass 248 and send DNU. Need discuss the solution internally with PA and domain owner by further. Refer the attached mail(1588v2 Long-time Test failed_discussion_20200212.msg).

[2020/2/7][chunhuzo] Analyze the logs, seems when the issue happened, ploam state change between O5 and O6 for a while, which cause synce loss. Pls refer the attachment(135.252.128.103root_20200203_152325).
Have sent mail to Intel Dima for discussion, no feedback yet. Pls refer the attachment(RE_ 1588v2 Long-time Test failed.msg).

[2020/1/19][chunhuzo/kerry] Mail discussion, code review and diff has been sent out, wait for the final conclusion. Mail attached(discussion_and_code_FR ALU02648035.msg).

[2020/1/17][chunhuzo] Solution confirmed, will remove PEE sent as it can not be received correctly after enable long luminous, also move setOperationStateToO7() to ISR from gpon task.

[2020/1/14][chunhuzo] Discussed via CS9578606, could use following command to force ploam state to O7
bs /b/c gpon link_activate=deactivate
bs /b/c gpon link_activate=activate_O7
But it will cause link state kept in O7, even receive Disable SN message with active option, only ploam state enter O5 and link state could not enter O1 and will always keep O7.
Discussed with Peihua, still use previous setOperationStateToO7() to switch ploam state to O7.
But need to move setOperationStateToO7() to ISR.
So the final thing is how to confirm PEE, because need to send PEE before close TX power.
Coding and under verification.

[2020/1/3][chunhuzo] Move to HD_R6201a based on previous discussion, Peihua suggest to use rdpa_gpon_link_activate_set(O7)  to replace setOperationStateToO7(). Checked function declaration, it could be used on task context.
But tested that ""bs /b/c gpon link_activate=activate_O7"" will fail, error info is as follows:
ERR: bdmf_configure#1544: gpon: status:Internal error. config:link_activate=activate_O7
Object configuration failed: Internal error
MON: Bdmf/Configure> failed with error code Internal error(-4)

Have submitted CS9578606 to track it.

This gateway was unreachable via CDP. See the attached screen shot for all the errors. We were unable to pull this customer via Nokia wifi portal since the Gateway was unreachable. We rebooted the ONT and the gateway started communicating to the CDP server.

We need to find out what was wrong with the Gateway communication and why the reboot cleared the issue.

Since 4 node testing with G-240W-J is not in scope of HDR 63, tested with FR with 3 nodes. 
Testing was done with 1 root (G-240W-J) along with 2 Extenders (B1).
ONT G-240W-J, Op Id : TLAR, CC : US
ONT B1, Op Id : NKNA, CC : us
Its taking around 10-15 mins to form mesh.
Steps:
1. Reboot ext 2 alone in the 3 node mesh.
2. Verify the state of Exr 1 in ONT Web GUI. -- ext 1 shows connected bad in webgui for some time.
3. after 10-15 mins, all 3 nodes are stable in mesh. Ext 2 comes back in mesh without any issues.
