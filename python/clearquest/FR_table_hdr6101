Problem: 
When running Fax T38 bulk call continuously, it may happen once after 12 hours for normal Network.

This issues only happen when using G729 codec as voice default codec and use T38 Fax call at the same time. If use G711 codec or use T30 for fax, it will not happen.
Workaround:

Workaround: None.
Impact customer: Medium."	"IPS 00425808
[20190619][jzhu1] Scenario is clear, kind of HW limitation for optics self-test, prefer to document it as HW/ONT limitation, confirming with PA/PLM.
[20190522][Hu David] Intel feedback is on anylsis. we need more investigation on this issue. Intel will not give us changed before we found the root cause. 
[20190403][Hu David] Have reproduced in our lab and collect the log to provide to Intel and raised the IPS:00425808. 
[20190313][Hu David] DaiMeng have tested as we asked to reboot the ONT one by one. But still have one ONT report the Mismatch Alarm. I have try to reproduced in my lab with BB version to collect the log with craft. But still not working. Maybe need to change it to Level 3 to keep on follow it.
[20190219][Hu David] with the log we collected and we found the same bahavior with FR:ALU02436577, we need PT to reproduced again with the way 10 seconds to reboot one ONT to check if it is the power issue. if the power issue, I think we need intel and platform to decide how to handle it.
[20190219][Hu David] Have send a BB version to collect the otop log to check the reason.
[20190218][Hu David] direct cause is clear now and we found the ONT changed from 05 to O2 states when the mismatch alarm occurred the root cause for the status changes need otop message to retrigger, We will provide a BB version to check the root cause and maybe the same issue as before: ALU02436577.
[20190201][Hu David] Mismatch happened on the mib_reset process. Need OMCI to check and analysis."	""	"Latest Status:

         Now R&D had confirm that root cause is BCM SW issue,Our SW team  are working with BCM support team together to fix this issue
[20190301][yimingg]HW liyong have some new findings, this issue may related BCM SW issue
                Possible hardware solutions could slightly improve the result and with large risks on other aspects
                Lab tests showed the root cause possibly resides in software,but need further check with SW people and Broadcom FAE
[20190215][yimingg]Since this is a minor issue with no real world impact,Nokia will not make a change at this time which requires a full Regulatory Compliance Testing cycle,but will,if there is an service impacting issue that requires a HW change.
[20190205][yimingg]R&D HW Liyong had done  traffic test and  explained the problem form design.
 Nokia acknowledges the ANSI X.3.263 100Base-TX specification is slightly below the bottom limit (0.92v vs 0.95),  it has been verified to have no impact on performance tests and exceeds the BER specification at maximum cable length.
All performance and function tests pass, and specifically traffic testing at the ethernet maximum cable length of 100 meter CAT5e cable in 100Base-TX and 1000Base-T mode passed with no packet error or loss occurred, and bit error ratio was measured as less than 10-12, better than requirements of 100Base-TX 10-9 and 1000Base-T 10-10.

We have investigated the core dump file and requested MTK support because the crash was located in MTK library.
But the investigation cannot go further only with existing information.

The probabilities of this crash is very low(1/3200) and it only occurred once.
And after sipc crash, the daemon monitor will reboot ONT again very soon, so we believe this will not be a big problem.

[2019/03/08][dhuan003]
An Fengqin helped to re-run the case and increase the warm times to 150, and the crash did not happen again.
So we believe the issue happens very rare and almost impossible to reproduce.

After discussion with PLAM(Ji Wendi) and tester(An Fengqin), the FR will be changed to P3.
We will add logs to print more information in case it happens again."	""	"Latest Status:

Problem: G-240W-F does not allow communication of central alarm unit with receiver, the alarm unit send the DTMF signal with about 50ms on and 100ms off, but DSP only detect the DTMF signal with 35ms detected threshold, that means DSP only treat the signal as DTMF after it has played 35ms.
Then DSP will remove the DSP signal and generate the DTMF rtp event.
So DSP only remove about 15ms DTMF signal and leave 35ms signal in rtp stream sent to alarm center.
That makes server treat both 2833 and inband received

solution 1 Modify the DTMF detected threshold from 35ms to the DSP min value 25ms.
This solution can only reduce 10ms inband DTMF signal, we dont know the behavior of alarm central. So we can not sure if this solution can work on costumer network.
solution2 Change the DTMF detected logic same as brcm(G240WA).
This solution can remove almost all inband DTMF signal, but this solution is very complex, DSP will provide the effort later."	""	"Latest Status:

[20190322][yaow]R&D has got 4 shipped ONTs from local. R&D has daily review meeting with local team to update the status.
[20190227][yaow]2 issued ONTs arrived Shanghai on Feb-25, and R&D is working on them and update the investigation status via mail. Other 2 issued ONTs are still on the way to Shanghai.
[20190213][yaow]Local will send the issued ONTs to R&D to check.
[20190115][zuqiangw]For case1, according to the serial log, the ""DL_ACTIVE"" and ""PHYLINKUP"" bits were all ""1"", that mean the PCIE devices can be detected and the PCIE physical link was interconnected. Besides, the many log such as ""sta_leave:192 - Unknown STA[88:36:5f:ec:78:43]"" are observed, this log may be related with wifi or other module, it needs to be checked by module owner deeply.
[20190116][zuqiangw]For case4, According to the serial log collected by TEC, the cause of  ""WLAN 5G LED was off"" is that the 5G wifi was not detected when ONU bootup, so the 5G wifi driver was not probed successfully. This issue is very similar with the issue that we encountered before and was finally solved by HW, I suggest the ONU should be post back NSB and we can further check it. Checked the working status of PCIE0, the 2.4G wifi driver was probed successfully, and the PCIE0 physical link was interconnected since ""DL_ACTIVE"" and ""PHYLINKUP"" bits were all ""1"", about the cause of ""device could not connect to WLAN2.4G"" and ""error set LanWlanObject :5"",  it should be further analyzed by WIFI team.

[NSTA] The reason for a failure of a TCP connection is important. If a sip server is not reachable, so no response at all is received, it has no sense to switch to another transport protocol, the sip server is simply out-of-service. If there is redundancy enabled, the CVP should try to failover to the secondary sip server.
RFC 3261:
If a reliable transport is being used, the client transaction SHOULD NOT start timer A (Timer A controls request retransmissions).  For any transport, the client transaction MUST start timer B with a value of 64*T1 seconds (Timer B controls transaction timeouts).
Since the sip stack should always follow RFC 3261, it will wait for timer B to expire, even for TCP, before it decides that the sip server is not responding. In other words the delay of 32 secs in case the sip server is not  answering is correct!
[Judy]  Thus the behavior  is correct, then we will reject the FR.

Problem: G-240W-F does not allow communication of central alarm unit with receiver, the alarm unit send the DTMF signal with about 50ms on and 100ms off, but DSP only detect the DTMF signal with 35ms detected threshold, that means DSP only treat the signal as DTMF after it has played 35ms.
Then DSP will remove the DSP signal and generate the DTMF rtp event.
So DSP only remove about 15ms DTMF signal and leave 35ms signal in rtp stream sent to alarm center.
That makes server treat both 2833 and inband received

This solution can only reduce 10ms inband DTMF signal, we dont know the behavior of alarm central. So we can not sure if this solution can work on costumer network.

Title:[HDR6101][G3][ALCL]when PC from AP send igmp join packet,G3 did not form multicast group as RGW ...
Problem: [HDR6101][G3][ALCL]when PC from AP send igmp join packet,G3 did not form multicast group as RGW...
Workaround:
test devices:
one G3, two B3

test topo:
PC1(VLC server)-----------G3(RGW)-----B3#1(AP bridge)------B3#2(AP bridge)-----PC2(VLC client)

PC1 send multicast resource, PC2 as client to receive igmp traffic.

real result:
multicast traffics of PC2 get frozen frequently.

debug action:
G3 could ping B3#1, B3#2 and vice versa.
1.send command on RGW serial 'igmpdbg dump all' to check whether there exist igmp group-----there was no igmp group
2.send command on B3#2 serial 'igmpdbg dump all' to check whether AP has received igmp join packets from PC2-----there exist igmp group, see the attachment. 
3.according to step 1 and 2, there were two situation:
a. RGW did not receive igmp packets from AP; 
b. RGW received igmp packets, but did not handle it.
4. according to situation of step 3.b, connect PC2 to RGW with ethernet cable, PC2 resend igmp join packets, repeat step 1, still not form igmp group.
5. considered if it concern about IGMP proxy, then create IPTV wan connection.-------see the attachment.
6. after step 5, PC2 send igmp join packets again, still not form igmp group

unium info is in the attachment.

[20190509][JennaLi]contact with submitter, explain the reason of alarm show up and its time. Submitter agree on that reject the FR or change it to OLT.
after the OLT cmd, ONT received and dealt it successfully.after admin-state down/up, OLT will send PoE control ME  to OLT, the ME ONT not fully implement, so there is a OMCI error return to OLT, thus the alarm ""minor alarm occurred for ontenet 1/1/3/1/2/1/1 (service affecting) : ONT didn't accept OMCI config request"" occurred.
firstly, G010SA do not supply function--provide power to external equipment, after run OLT cmd to enable this function, the ONT worked good, this is a normal and good performance;secondly, ONT received not identified ME from OLT and return an OMCI error, then OLT shows the alarm , this is a  desired outcome.as a result, there is no irregular behavior on ONT.
submitter agreed to this opinion, and let wait to reject the FR or change to OLT.

contact with PLM of G-010S-A, the ONT do not support this function (provide power to external equipment).
contact with OLT GPON management team. this alarm occurs when OLT receive an OMCI error message.

Expected Results: 
1.Every unidirectional data stream is about 8M,packet loss is a%(a%<1%). 
2.For Bidirectional stream,up stream value should be close to down stream value,total stream value is close to max unidirectional value(load is 64)  . 
3.Clients should not be disconnect with target AP and stream should not be disturbed during 2 hours 

Test Results: 
For Bidirectional stream, stream value is  much lower than unidirectional value(load is 64)  .

[20190613][tobyw] From the OMCI log of my BB, I find that when the lower is greater than the upper thresh, the OLT responds with ERROR PARAMETER. However, there is no error displayed on the OLT and 'video optical level too low' alarms still appear. Need to be checked further.

[20190606][tobyw] From the OMCI log I have confirmed that the lower video optical thresh can be greater than the upper one, so ONT should detect this situation and then refuse the configuration. I have preliminarily completed coding and submitted a BB for test. 

[20190603][luckh] confirmed with submitter that, this FR will only track the 3rd issue: when upper < lower configuration is downloaded to ONU, ONU shall refuse the configuration. other two issues will be tracked by FR: ALU02583761 by OLT team."	""	"Latest Status:

Impact customer: ..."	"[20190606][qianli]By check the omci log, I have found the root cause, and this is a well known issue, Chennai team is preparing to resolve this issue.

Root cause:
When do reboot, upgrade and other process which will cause mib reset on ONU, OLT will send ""set OLT-G"" message to ONU. Chennai team commit a new RCR a few days before, add some process in OLT-G, and there is something wrong about these code, so the process of OLT-G been block, which make OMCI can't response OLT timely, and then OLT will resend ""set OLT-G"" message, after OLT resend this message for 3 times, OLT think there is something wrong with ONU, so it will send ""get ONT DATA"" messages for 32 times, after ONU response all the messages that OLT sends, the OLT will send other messages, after all the messages that ONU process successfully, the ONU will get online, so in this period, the ONU status in OLT is down.
Wait for Chennai team committing code."	""	"Latest Status:

Submitter has to make sure the connectivity between CDP and ONT has to check further. 

How it works with periodic inform as 3 s:
-----------------------------------------------
Beacon will communicate CDP for every periodic inform interval as heartbeat check, so when we set as less value ~3, beacon will contact CDP every 3 secs so all queued up jobs will get succeeded from CDP -> Beacon

Workaround: No 
Impact customer: Upgrade"	"[20190626][luckh] cfgmgr didn't complete initializatoin(db migration job may be), then get no time to start up omcimgr/parser etc... Deamon process will reboot ONT if mandatory processes are not up. Involve cfgmgr owner to check. But this is really a big span between the two build(AONT_R3.0.0 <-> HDR6101NAR)
[20190626][luckh] passive image is activated by OLT, ONT was rebooted. but with this build, the ONT can't get ranged. Ploam kept in O1. serial log/syslog are provided to platform team to further check. 
[20190625][luckh] G-241G-A supported since R57 with sharing the G440GA sip image only. So, this is test configuration issue, not sw issue.
[20190624][luckh] DL_ACT is received, and the ONT get rebootted to load AONT_R3.0.0 build, but the ONU can't get initialized with this build. Need platform team check. email to Bai Ming."	""	"Latest Status:

check test result in apitest log(http://192.168.1.1:8080/apitest/index.htm) it seems ok. but check traffic statistic info via testcenter, no stream speed be limited. (still 50M)"	""	""	"Latest Status:
